- Crossplatform: To be easily installed and working on Linux and Mobile Operation Systems (Android etc). Or at least relatively easily to be turned to application supporting these platforms. (Xamarin.Forms/Uno supports mobile natively. Electron based app needs to be converted to a web app.)

- app components (which I must be able to build in my app or buy from 3rd party for the platform I will use)    - Using browser component with DOM model access (ideally smth chrome based like Cefsharp)     - Other components: MarkDown Editor like Typora, Graph visualization, Diagram visualization - watch video for details: [https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cY6OiIsI38](https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cY6OiIsI38) (sorry for my English). It would be just great if I can implement them on the platform we pick without any 3rd party paid libraries (components). (All has browser controls.) (Typora is not free. Similar controls like https://simplemde.com/ in JavaScript can be wrapped as .NET controls https://alekseychan.github.io/mdNote/) (Graph and diagram visualization can be done via several libraries, such as SkiaSharp)
